    <h2>Description</h2>
 
    <p>Hyderabadi Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish originating from the city of Hyderabad, India. It is made with basmati rice, marinated meat (usually chicken or mutton), and a blend of spices. The dish is known for its rich aroma and taste, often cooked using the dum method where the ingredients are slow-cooked together to enhance the flavors.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g basmati rice</li>
            <li>500g chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>4-5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, marinate the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, mint leaves, coriander leaves, garam masala, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the whole spices (cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaves, cumin seeds) and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and add the soaked rice along with some salt. Cook the rice until it is about 70% done (it should still have a bite).</li>
            <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken in the pot. Cover it tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to trap the steam.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes (dum cooking) to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot with raita or salad.</li>
        </ol>
