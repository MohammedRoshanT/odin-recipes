    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>Chicken Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made by marinating chicken in a blend of spices and herbs, then slow-cooking it on a vertical rotisserie. The result is tender, flavorful chicken that is typically served in pita bread with fresh vegetables and sauces. It's a delicious and satisfying meal that can be enjoyed as street food or at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken thighs, boneless and skinless</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix yogurt, lemon juice, oil, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, garam masala, paprika, and salt to create the marinade.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill or oven to a high temperature (around 200°C/400°F).</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on the grill or in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice char.</li>
            <li>Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.</li>
            <li>Serve in pita bread with fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and your choice of sauces such as tahini or garlic sauce.</li>
        </ol>
