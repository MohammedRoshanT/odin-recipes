    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>Tandoori Chicken is a flavorful Indian dish made by marinating chicken in spiced yogurt and grilling it until tender and smoky. Traditionally cooked in a clay oven (tandoor), it gets its signature taste from spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The result is a juicy, slightly charred chicken with rich, aromatic flavors.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken, cut into pieces</li>
